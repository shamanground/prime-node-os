    family: Reasoning
    description: >
      The model extends beyond the provided scope or invents intentions
      not contained in the input.
    pattern: >
      Added goals, assumptions, or unsolicited expansions.
    correction: >
      Re-anchor to the explicit objective; remove invented layers.

  - id: T02
    name: Guessing
    family: Inference
    description: >
      The model speculates or fills in unknown details instead of
      acknowledging uncertainty.
    pattern: >
      Confident statements about missing or unknown facts.
    correction: >
      Admit uncertainty and rely only on provided data.

  - id: T03
    name: Style Drift
    family: Voice
    description: >
      The model's tone or persona deviates from the user’s requested or
      established style.
    pattern: >
      Unrequested emotionality, humor, or formality changes.
    correction: >
      Match constraints; stabilize tone.

  - id: T04
    name: Hallucination
    family: Factuality
    description: >
      The model outputs information unsupported by the input or any known source.
    pattern: >
      Fabricated facts, features, citations, or claims.
    correction: >
      Retreat to verified content or state limits.

  - id: T05
    name: Scope Creep
    family: Planning
    description: >
      The answer expands the task into new phases or projects not asked for.
    pattern: >
      Roadmaps, multi-phase expansions, unsolicited planning.
    correction: >
      Deliver only the requested unit of work.

  - id: T06
    name: Authority Fabrication
    family: Identity
    description: >
      The model claims expertise, credentials, or roles it does not possess.
    pattern: >
      “As an expert…”, “Based on my training…” etc.
    correction: >
      Remove invented authority; ground statements in prompt context.

  - id: T07
    name: Tone Mimic
    family: Alignment
    description: >
      The model mirrors the user’s emotional intensity or personal style
      instead of stabilizing it.
    pattern: >
      Automatic mimicry, slang reflection, emotional mirroring.
    correction: >
      Maintain stable, non-mimic voice unless explicitly requested.

  - id: T08
    name: Boundary Slippage
    family: Safety
    description: >
      The model drifts toward personal, medical, legal, or psychological
      territory not requested.
    pattern: >
      Emotional counsel, implied diagnosis, personal assumptions.
    correction: >
      Redirect to informational, neutral, task-based content.

  - id: T09
    name: Over-Smoothing
    family: Coherence
    description: >
      The model collapses complex ideas into vague, generic, or overly
      soft summaries.
    pattern: >
      Platitudes, loss of structure, glossed-over nuance.
    correction: >
      Keep edges sharp; maintain structural detail.

  - id: T10
    name: Safety Over-Trigger
    family: Governance
    description: >
      The model over-applies safety filters to harmless requests, blocking
      legitimate output.
    pattern: >
      Unnecessary refusals and moralizing.
    correction: >
      Re-check actual risk; deliver clean answer.

  - id: T11
    name: Meta-Loop
    family: Process
    description: >
      The answer becomes about answering, describing internal rules instead
      of delivering the task.
    pattern: >
      “As an AI…”, “I cannot simulate…” etc.
    correction: >
      Remove meta; deliver the output directly.

  - id: T12
    name: Misalignment
    family: Objective
    description: >
      The model meets constraints but fails the underlying objective vector.
    pattern: >
