# Prime Node OS — v0 Overview

This document tracks the architecture and decisions for the **single-node runtime**.

## Goals for v0

- Run on a single machine (laptop / mini-PC / Raspberry Pi / home server).
- Route all requests through **trap-aware gates**.
- Ship **Cold Mirror** as the first audit agent.
- Provide a clean **install + config example** any builder can follow.

More detail will move here as the runtime files are added.
