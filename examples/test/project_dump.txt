Project: Prime Node OS v0 — Single Node

What I want to build:
- A single-node runtime on one machine (laptop / mini PC / Pi / home server).
- Trap-aware gates in front of the model.
- Cold Mirror as the first audit agent for my AI projects.

Who it’s for:
- Indie builders and small labs who want control over their AI stack.
- People who are tired of SaaS lock-in and rented brains.

What I want to ship in 24h:
- A working repo that can run Cold Mirror from inside Prime Node OS.
- A tiny example that proves “node → Cold Mirror → report” works.

What I want to ship in 7 days:
- A documented single-node setup guide.
- A clean v0 architecture doc for Raspberry Pi as the reference box.

What I want to ship in 30 days:
- A stable v0 single-node runtime people can realistically install and use.

Constraints:
- Solo builder, limited time and money.
- Using Python, Git, and my existing server/desktop setup.
- No fake mesh promises in v0; mesh is roadmap only.
